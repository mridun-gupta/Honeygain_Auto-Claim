# **Honeygain Auto-Claim Script**

A Python script to automatically claim the Honeygain daily lucky pot and any available achievements.

This script is designed to be run on a daily schedule using GitHub Actions. It securely uses your account credentials (email and password) via your repository's encrypted secrets to log in and claim your credits.

## **Features**

* Claims the daily Lucky Pot (if available).  
* Claims all completed achievements (if available).  
* Generates a local HoneygainToken.json to manage your session.  
* Logs all actions to a file for easy debugging.  
* Designed for headless environments like GitHub Actions.
